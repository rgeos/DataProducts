In this area you have  
- Outcome drop down dialog from where you can choose  
 + Miles per gallon
 + Horse power

- Predictor radio button choices with
 + Number of cylinders
 + Type of transmission (manual, automatic)
- A regression model boolean option

You can choose a combination of `Outcome` and `Predictor` in order to plot a

the page 4 charts representing the relation between the automatically chosen
predictive variables.
